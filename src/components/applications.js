          <p>The trend in many industries to embrace IoT, Autonomy and Augmented Reality Visualization 
              is creating a large high-accuracy positioning market for lower-cost devices and services. 
              Significant challenges remain in obtaining high-accuracy position data using low-cost GNSS 
              receivers due to their tendency to obtain poor quality measurements especially under challenging 
              environments. HYFIXâ€™s software and services help solve these challenges and unlock new applications 
              that benefit from high accuracy positioning.</p>

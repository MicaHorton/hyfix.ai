            <p className='section-text'> The trend in many industries to embrace IoT, Autonomy and Augmented Reality Visualization 
                is creating a large high-accuracy positioning market for lower-cost devices and services. 
                Significant challenges remain in obtaining high-accuracy position data using low-cost GNSS 
                receivers due to their tendency to obtain poor quality measurements especially in challenging 
                environments. HYFIXâ€™s software and services help solve these challenges and unlock new applications 
                that benefit from high accuracy positioning.</p>

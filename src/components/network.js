          <p>HYFIX aspires to build the largest global RTK network with fully modernized receivers 
              to provide hardware-agnostic and open-standards based correction services. We plan to 
              realize this goal is by establishing close partnerships with hardware providers to deploy 
              new base stations, supplementing with existing open networks , forming alliances with 
              regional public network services and collaborating with local independent. 
              By deploying a global network of base stations, HYFIX will provide cost-effective, 
              high precision data and correction services to users globally.</p>

                The trend in many industries is to embrace IoT, Autonomy and
                Augmented Reality Visualization is creating a large
                high-accuracy positioning market for lower cost devices and
                services. Significant challenges remain in obtaining
                high-accuracy position data using low-cost GNSS receivers due to
                their tendency to obtain poor quality measurements especially in
                challenging environments. HYFIXâ€™s software and services help
                solve these challenges and unlock new applications that benefit
                from high accuracy positioning.

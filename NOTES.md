# Solved Bugs

- Image height has to be set to auto. Otherwise, text will run over it and it won't be part of normal flow on mobile.
- NPM Deploy Error. Just run NPM install to update package.json file

# Design Questions

- Should I center the text on web like I did on mobile?
- Also, maybe I should visually center things by making them a little higher than usual (that should be baked into css protocol)?
